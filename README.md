## Data Description

The dataset used in this project contains information related to insurance policies, customer preferences, and other relevant variables. It includes 52 columns, each representing different aspects of the data, such as customer demographics, policy details, and excess options.

## Analysis Highlights

### Key Insights from the `ExcessSelected` Column:
1. **Dominance of a Default Option**: Most customers choose a single dominant excess option, possibly due to its default status or wide appeal.
2. **Low Uptake of Other Options**: Few customers select alternative options, indicating potential gaps in awareness or alignment with customer needs.
3. **Range of Options**: While multiple options exist, they are underutilized, signaling opportunities for improved communication and marketing.

These insights can guide strategies to enhance customer engagement and refine policy offerings.
